A collaborative static web page embedding Spotify Playlist from Xin community

Welcome to our collaborative static web page that features embedded playlists from our Discord community server!

Overview:
Our website serves as a platform where members of the Discord community server can showcase their music taste and share their favorite songs and playlists with others. The website is designed as a static web page, meaning that it is not regularly updated with new content. However, the embedded playlists and songs are dynamically sourced by Spotify playlist

How it works:
To contribute to the website, members of our Discord server can submit their Spotify playlist links to our designated GitHub repository. We will add the link to the page. The website then fetches the songs and playlists from Spotify and displays them on the web page.

Usage:
To access the website, simply visit the URL provided. The main page will display all the songs and playlists contributed by members. To listen to a particular song or playlist, simply click on the embedded player and start streaming the music.

Contributing:
If you're a member of the server, you can contribute to the website by submitting your Spotify playlist link to our designated GitHub repository. Please ensure that your song or playlist is set to public and contains appropriate content before submitting.

Feedback:
We welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have regarding our website. You can reach out to us via our Spotify community server or through the contact form provided on the website.

Thank you for visiting our collaborative static web page and happy listening!
